# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection is an important application of machine learning, which involves building a model to detect fraudulent transactions made using credit cards. Logistic Regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for this task

The project would involve the following steps:

Data collection: Collecting a dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both normal and fraudulent transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the dataset to remove any irrelevant or missing data, and perform feature scaling and normalization to make the data suitable for logistic regression.

Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features that can help in detecting frauds, using techniques like correlation analysis or principal component analysis (PCA).

Model Building: Training a logistic regression model on the preprocessed dataset. The logistic regression algorithm can help in predicting the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help in determining the effectiveness of the model in detecting frauds.


Overall, the goal of this project would be to build a highly accurate model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time, to help protect customers and financial institutions from financial losses due to fraud.
